DeepLearnNLP
============

matlab implementation of a deep convolutional neural network (aka CNN) for natural language processing.
DeepLearnNLP learns grammatical structure (without human interference) in order to predict the next word in a sentence.

training data: 350k 4-word phrases
architecture: 
  - supervised learning
  - 4 layers (2 hidden)
  - logistic neurons in lower layers
  - softmax output layer
  - cross-entropy error function
